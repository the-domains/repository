I have been a fan and almost exclusive user of Chrome for the past 7 years or so. 

However, for a while now I've found that Chrome has been eating up more of my computer resources than it should, and have found it more and more sluggish. The convenience of Chrome for me lies in primarily two things: synced bookmarks and add-ons.

The reason I am going back to Firefox now is that yesterday I was playing League of Legends on my computer, and noticed weird lag. My ping was not higher than usual, but the gameplay experience was pretty bad. 

My friend told me it's not a ping issue, but a computer issue, and asked me if I had other programs running while playing. 

I said no, just my web browser (because to me having a web browser opened shouldn't impact my computer's performance while playing a relatively undemanding --in terms of CPU/GPU load-- game like League of Legends).

Still, I opened the task manager and found that Chrome was using all of 15% of my CPU, while not even using it actively. 

Honestly I don't know how often Chrome uses that much of my CPU, but I think if I am not actively using it, it shouldn't cause issues while running other programs.

It turns out that closing Chrome solved my LoL performance issues.

For the record, I have an i7 (2600K @3.4Ghz) with a Geforce GTX580 graphics card, and 8GB RAM, so while not the latest generation hardware, it's still way above recommended specs for that game.

The jump was also facilitated by the option to import my bookmarks from Chrome.

It also lets you create an account to sync your bookmarks.
